- 👋 Hi, I’m Tankut Şentürk
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly Elixir / Erlang & Ruby.
- 🌱 I’m fun of "Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in 
different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and 
avoid getter struck in a rut."
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Elixir / Erlang projects.
- 📫 I'll find you.. :)
